Anyone interested in practicing python via django, feel free to check out this repo that I'll be using to make a simple business card site for a bike shop as a submission to GoCodeColorado. The prize is $1000 I'm hoping to give to one of the off season bike mechanics. The shops name is Velowood Cyclery and all they have right now is a Instagram. It's the first year for the new owner and they do good work, so I'm trying to help them out a little and practice a bit of python (and vim) at the same time. There are a couple of data sets I'm thinking of using (https://data.colorado.gov/browse?q=bike&sortBy=relevance), perhaps just in csv for right now. Maybe just the bike maps. Here are the rules again, the submission is due by Thursday and it needs to use public data. There is a 90 second video involved, which I could record with quicktime on a screenshare if you're interested. I might also do some data analysis/visualization or maybe put in a dialogue flow chatbot. Let me know if anyone is interested and I can make a separate channel for more details.
